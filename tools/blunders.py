"""Count elementary mistakes in self-play match transcripts.

Runs bin/showgame over a range of seeds and reports, per side:

  doomed opens    expeditions that finished with <= 3 cards and a clearly
                  negative score (< -8): opening a suit you cannot fund is the
                  most visible beginner error in Lost Cities
  wasted wagers   expeditions whose wagers multiplied a negative sum (score
                  below -20 with at least one wager): a wager on a failing
                  expedition doubles the damage
  instant gifts   a discard the opponent picked up on their very next turn and
                  ultimately played into a positive expedition: handing the
                  opponent exactly the card they wanted

These are heuristics for "elementary", not exhaustive; the same numbers run on
different checkpoints make progress (or regress) visible.
