/* lc.h -- Lost Cities game engine (2 player, Reiner Knizia).
 *
 * Rules implemented (standard 2-player game; competitive play is a match of
 * three rounds with cumulative scoring -- the State carries the match context
 * so agents can condition on it, and the round loops live in the callers):
 *   Deck: 5 suits x 12 cards = 60.  Per suit: three wagers ("handshakes") and
 *   the number cards 2..10.
 *   Setup: each player is dealt 8 cards.
 *   Turn: (1) play a card to one of your own expeditions, or discard it to the
 *   shared discard pile of its suit; (2) draw one card, either the top of the
 *   draw deck or the top of any discard pile -- except the pile you just
 *   discarded to on this same turn.
 *   Expeditions are strictly ascending in value; wagers may only be added
 *   before any number card of that suit.
 *   The game ends immediately after the turn in which the last deck card is
 *   drawn.
 *   Scoring per started expedition: (sum of numbers - 20) * (1 + wagers),
 *   plus a 20 point bonus if the expedition holds 8 or more cards.
